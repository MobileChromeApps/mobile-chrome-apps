## Release Notes

For detailed release notes for plugins, refer to each plugin's `README.md`.

For Android / iOS detailed release notes, refer to `RELEASENOTES.md` with `cordova/cordova-android` and `cordova/cordova-ios`

### v0.1.1 (June 25, 2014)
* This is an exciting and significant milestone release!
* *Important*: Android applications now run inside a new packaged chromium-based webview, using the [Crosswalk Project](https://crosswalk-project.org/)!
  * This webview is currently based on Chrome/36, and supports WebGL, Accelerated Canvas, WebRTC, WebAudio, runs polymer without polyfills, and more!
  * Few caveats:
    * size of apk has increased by ~35Mb (expect that to decrease to ~18Mb very soon)
    * You must use Chrome 36+ on desktop to use remote debugging via web inspector
  * You can opt-out of this webview by setting `"webview": "system"` in `manifest.mobile.json`
* *Important*: New `cca push [--watch]` command to work with the [Chrome App Developer Tool for Mobile](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/chrome-app-developer-tool)
    * This is an awesome new workflow for rapid application development, we suggest you try it out!
* New: `cca upgrade` command, will re-add latest platforms and plugins
  * Additionally, cca will prompt for upgrade whenever it detects a new cca version is installed (use `cca --skip-upgrade` to ignore this)
  * No longer necessary to re-create projects every time you `npm update -g cca`!
  * Note: upgrade will delete `platforms/` and `plugins/` so make sure you donâ€™t have local edits
* cca will now remove chrome plugins when you remove api permissions from your manifest
* Added `geolocation` permission support
* `chrome.socket` bugfixes and better cleanup of lingering connections.
